						ColiMinder CMI-02-LE is a low-energy 
						version of Industrial ColiMinder CMI-02. 
						It can be powered by 12V batteries, 100/240V 
						to 12V ACDC power supply or by a car 
						electrical system. 
					</p>
					<p>
						ColiMinder CMI-02-LE serves in areas with 
						reduced power supply for long-term monitoring 
						of bio-contaminated water samples. It can be 
						installed in areas with rough environmental 
						conditions (IP65 protection).

						ColiMinder CMI-02-ERU (Emergency Response 
						Unit) provides the capability to measure 
						microbiological contamination on the road 
						taking sample from different sources or 
						locations.
					</p>
					<p>
						With a ColiMinder CMI-02-LE serving as base, 
						the ERU is assembled on a rack and dedicated 
						for mobile use or as a driving lab, e.g. in 
						cars or on a boat.
					</p>
					<p>
						It is equipped with batteries and all 
						necessary equipment with consumables for 100 
						measurements. It can also be deployed for 
						continuous monitoring when being equipped 
						with different canisters.
					</p>
					<p>
						Using integrated multisampling unit, 
						ColiMinder can measure up to 10 samples one 
						after the other on the way to the next 
						sampling site.
					</p>
					<p>
						ColiMinder CMI-02-ERU has an internal 4G 
						modem and can be powered by a 12V DC car 
						system or any DC source between 12 and 30V 
						DC. Solar panels or power packs can be 
						directly connected.
